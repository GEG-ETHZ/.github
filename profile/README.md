## Welcome 

to the Organization Page of the [Geothermal Energy and Geofluids Group](https://geg.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. 
This group works on problems concerning reactive fluid (water, CO2, CxHy, N2) and (geothermal) energy (heat, pressure) transfer in the Earthâ€™s crust.
Methods to study this field range from computer simulations, to laboratory experiments and field analyses, with the aim to gain fundamental insights 
and to address a wide range of societal goals and concerns.

Software development at GEG is aimed to be beneficial to the community. Thus, open-source code developed at GEG is published and maintained in this 
github organization.
